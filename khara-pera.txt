½ cup (120 ml) unsalted butter, at room temperature
2/3 cup (60 g) confectioners’ sugar
1 ¾ cups (220 g) dry milk powder, or as needed
1 teaspoon (5 ml) milk or cream, or as necessary
a few drops of flavoring essence (as suggested above), or 
      2 tablespoons (30 ml) grated nuts or dried fruit puree

1.    Cream the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Using your hands, work in the milk powder and milk or cream, (adjusting proportions as necessary) to make a medium-soft fondant. Flavor with essence, nuts or fruit puree and continue to work until well blended.
2.    Wash and dry your hands, then roll the fondant into smooth balls. (You can also roll the fondant around whole nuts or sandwich a pellet between nut halves). Place the confections in paper candy cases and keep refrigerated in a well sealed container for up to 4 days. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
